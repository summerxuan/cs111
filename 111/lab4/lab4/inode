inode 
structure
derect pointer ---------> data blocks
indirect pointer --------> table of direct pointers -------------->data
indirect pointer2 -------->table of indirect pointers------------->
directories are inodes too
type = OSPFS_FTYPT_DIR
pointer does not points to row data
points to directory data block
directory entry
directory entry data
-----------
etc
-----------
bin
-----------
usr
-----------
home (ino 12) ------> turker (ino 1000) -----> file inode     
-----------
inodes do not have filename field
File system level: superblock
– os_magic # marker
//variable check if we are
– os_nblocks # blocks
//how many blocks do we have
– os_ninodes # inodes
//number of inodes
– os_firstinob # offset
 //first inode block
 we can not hardlink to directory
if the thing you pointes to is not terminal, may create infinite loop
when creating the hardlink
add one more directory entry
symbolic links
contains a pathname
creating a symbolic link
the inode has the type symbolic, and the pathname,
the OS will loop up for the pathname
hard link is faster only look up once
