Our code successfully accomplished the functionality in the following procedure:
1. read file into a buffer;
2. Convert characters from the buffer into token streams, each of which consists of tokens for one specific command;
3. Build command trees and then connect trees to command stream;
4. Pass the first command_stream to read_command_stream function;
5. the read_command_stream function iteratively returns the head command.
