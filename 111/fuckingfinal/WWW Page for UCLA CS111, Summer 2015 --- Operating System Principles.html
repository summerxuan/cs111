<H1>Information for UCLA CS111, Summer 2015 --- Operating System Principles</H1>

<P>

This page is organized by the weeks of the quarter in which lectures were
given.  The weeks are in inverse order, on the
assumption you will most often be looking for the most recent week.

<P>
This class will be taught by Peter Reiher. The textbook is <em>Principles of
Computer System Design</em>, 
by Jerome Saltzer and Frans Kaashoek.
Assigned readings are from this book, unless otherwise indicated.
Some chapters of this textbook are not in the hard copy version, but are
only available on-line.  For these readings, I will provide a URL.
<P>
I will be lecturing on <A HREF="http://www.lasr.cs.ucla.edu/classes/cs111_summer2015/syllabus.pdf">
these subjects</A> during the class.   Note that this syllabus is a statement
of my intentions, NOT a guarantee that particular things will happen on 
particular dates.  If you need to ensure that a vacation or business trip does
not conflict with an important part of the class, speak to me.  Don't just
assume that the syllabus is absolutely correct.
<P>
The slides used in the lectures are posted in Powerpoint via links below for 
the particular
week in which the lecture was given.  Because some people have trouble
with the Powerpoint versions of the slides, I am also posting PDF versions.
The PDF versions do not support the animations, however.
<P>
<H3>Office Hours</H3>
My office hours are 1-2 Tuesdays and Thursday.  They are held in 3532F Boelter
Hall.  If you need to see me but can't come to these office hours, send me email.
I'm on campus a lot and we can probably work out another time. 
<P>
<H3>TA and Labs</H3>
<P>
The TA for the course is Turker Garip (mtgarip@cs.ucla.edu).  He will be responsible for all issues related to the
lab projects and design problems.  Questions on these should be directed to him.
<P>
I will make the basic lab materials available on this site.  Solutions will be handed in via the Summer Session CCLE site.
<P>
<H3>Final Examination</H3>
<P>
The final examination for CS 111 will be held during the regular recitation 
section time on Friday, August 14, in BH 2444.  The final exam is open book,
open notes.  You may either write your answers on paper or provide a PDF version
of your answers at the end of the exam period.  
<P>
The exam will cover the entire class, including all lecture material and all
assigned readings.  Any material covered ONLY as part of one of the labs will
not appear on the test, though material covered in both lecture and labs could
be there.  The final exam questions will emphasize understanding of important
concepts and design alternatives, and will require you to apply them to new problems
we have not discussed in class.  Here are some <A HREF="http://www.lasr.cs.ucla.edu/classes/cs111_summer2015/example_final_questions.pdf">sample final
exam questions</A> that are similar in nature to what might appear on the
test, along with guidelines for suitable answers.  You will be given a choice
of six questions, from which you can choose any three to answer that you
want.
<P>
One note on covered material: some lectures include "hidden slides," which 
were not lectured on.  Material that is found ONLY on these hidden slides (and 
not, for example, in assigned readings) will not appear on the final exam.
The PDF versions of the lectures do not distinguish between regular slides
and hidden slides, so if you want to avoid studying this material, look at
them in the Powerpoint version.
<P>
<H2>Week 8 (August 10  - August 16)</H2>
<P>
We have fallen behind on lectures, so only one new lecture will be posted
this week.

<H2>Week 6 (July 27  - August 2)</H2>
<P>
I will be out of town for this entire week, and thus will not be holding the lectures
or office hours.  To prevent us from falling further behind, 
I have taped two lectures for this week and made them available to you on line.
You should watch each of them at some time during this week.  They are each
divided into three parts, to allow you to deal with them in shorter pieces, 
rather than one long lecture.  I have also posted the Powerpoint slides and the
PDF versions of those slides, along with pointers to readings for these lectures.
<P>
You may need to either be on campus or using the UCLA VPN to access these 
taped lectures.
<P>
Turker, our TA, will hold his recitation section and office hours as usual.

Only one lecture is assigned this week, since I have effectively fallen a full
lecture behind.  The midterm exam will cover the material through lecture 7, 
including slides, material discussed in class sessions, and all readings.  The
slides and readings that I posted earlier for lecture 8 are NOT covered on the midterm.

<H2>Week 1 (June 22  - June 28)</H2>
<P>
I have to be out of town on the first day of class, June 23.  We will therefore
handle this week a bit differently than other weeks.  The first session of
class on Tuesday June 23 will be taught by Turker Garip, our TA.  He will 
discuss introductory material and start you off on the lab assignments, which
are a major component of the class.  I will lecture on Thursday, June 25 and
during the recitation section on Friday, June 26.  In subsequent weeks, we 
will return to the normal schedule, with my lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays
and a recitation section on Fridays.
